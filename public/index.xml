      <description>Hey guys! Wrting after a short break and hoping to keep it on from now on. So here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. I love listening to music and I had lots of different music in my mac&amp;rsquo;s music folder. I used to copy collections from my friends and add them to my music folder. And after a certain point, I started loosing track of what&amp;rsquo;s there. Because each folder would have subfolders. And I found multiple copies of the same music in different folders.</description>

      <description>Occasionally we download a lot of photos from Facebook. Downloading photos is really simple too : Just right click the mouse and select save image as. But what if you want to download bulk images, like 50 or 100 (for instance, you are into this girl and you want to save all the best albums of your crush) ? Will you select each and every pic and do the same process?</description>

      <description>Sometimes, receiving mails continuously can be such a pain. If you are facing this problem, and if you are a Gmail user, be happy to know that it is possible to adjust Gmail to let in the incoming mail at a specified time. You can pause the inbox to block the mails coming to your inbox.
